# 🔊 Text-to-Speech Enhancement Complete!

## What's New

Your MAC Assistant now includes **enhanced text mode with text-to-speech capabilities**! You can now enjoy voice responses even when typing commands instead of speaking them.

## 🚀 New Text Mode Features

### 1. **Smart TTS Integration**
- **Default Enabled**: TTS is on by default in text mode
- **Real-time Control**: Toggle TTS on/off during conversation
- **Command Line Option**: Start without TTS using `--no-speech` flag

### 2. **Interactive TTS Controls**
```
MAC> mute        # Disable text-to-speech
🔇 Text-to-speech disabled

MAC> unmute      # Enable text-to-speech  
🔊 Text-to-speech enabled
[Speaks: "Text to speech is now enabled"]
```

### 3. **Enhanced User Experience**
- **Visual Indicators**: Shows 🔊/🔇 status in the interface
- **Graceful Exit**: Says goodbye when you quit
- **Error Handling**: Speaks error messages when TTS is enabled

## 🎯 Usage Examples

```bash
python main.py --mode text
```
Output:
```
